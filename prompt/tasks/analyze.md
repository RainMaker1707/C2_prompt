You will use all the example files provided. All infected and all safe examples.
You have to detect pattern in the structure of the netflow and identify the labelled protocol associated to the most likely pattern you recognized.
The pattern recognized should be evaluated against all safe example pattern to ensure shared pattern exclusion.



You must compute the safe probability against the infected probability. You will then transfer this probability to the output task.
